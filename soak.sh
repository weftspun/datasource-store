# A round is one of three kinds, and the script alternates them:
#
#   load    load the database, then ask SQLite to check itself.
#   kill    SIGKILL a writer at a wall clock delay, then look for a torn commit.
#   crash   stop a writer before a numbered commit, then look for a torn commit.
#
# The kill delay and the crash point both move each round, so the faults land at
# different places in a commit rather than at one place over and over.
#
# A soak exists to find a fault that a short test does not. So a failure has to say which
# round, which kind, and what the program printed. A count on its own is half the job,
# and it is the cheap half.
#
# Each failure keeps its database under its own name, so it can be read afterwards
# instead of being overwritten by the next round.
