# Form a FoundationDB cluster from whatever machines Fly has started.
#
# The problem this solves. A coordinator list has to be written into a cluster file before
# any process starts, and on Fly a machine's address does not exist until the machine does.
# There is no address to write at build time and no machine to ask at deploy time, so the
# list is discovered at boot instead: every machine resolves the app's internal DNS, which
# returns an AAAA record for each machine in the app, and waits until it sees the expected
# count.
#
# Why waiting for a *count* rather than starting with whoever answers. A cluster file naming
# one coordinator is a valid cluster file. Three machines that each wrote their own would
# form three single-node clusters that never merge, and the deploy would look successful --
# `fly status` reports three healthy machines and every one of them serves reads. That is the
# failure this waits to avoid, and it is why WEFT_FDB_MACHINES is required rather than
# defaulted: a default would silently be wrong on the day someone scales to five.

# hostname against the address it connected to. On 6PN there is no hostname to match anyway,
# since peers reach each other at IPv6 literals.
#

# It was the NIC first, and a NIC does not survive `fly machine update`: the same three
# machines came back as ee13/30cb where they had been 3678/fbc7, so every certificate named
# hardware that no longer existed and all three refused to start. The machine ID did not move
# across any of those updates -- it is the identity Fly keeps, and the volume is attached to
# it -- so it is the thing worth naming.

	# Let's Encrypt hands out an issuer chain that ends at a *cross-signed* root -- here
	# `ISRG Root X2` as signed by `ISRG Root X1` -- and not at a self-signed one. OpenSSL's
	# `verify` accepts that, because `-CAfile` treats every certificate in the file as a
	# trust anchor, so a check built on it reports OK. FoundationDB does not: it wants a path
	# to a self-signed root, and without one every handshake fails with
	# `TLSPolicyFailure Reason="preverification"`.
	#
	# The failure mode is the expensive part. The processes start, report healthy, speak TLS
	# to each other perfectly, and never form a quorum -- `status` says only "Could not
	# communicate with a quorum of coordination servers", which reads like a networking or
	# coordinator problem and not like a certificate one.
	#
	# Only the roots that actually anchor this chain are appended, rather than the system
	# bundle. Appending the bundle would work and would quietly widen the trusted issuer set
	# from one CA to every public CA, leaving `S.CN` as the only thing between this cluster
	# and anyone who can get a certificate for the name.
	# The CA file is used exactly as given. Nothing is appended and nothing is truncated.
	#
	# An earlier version completed the chain from the system trust store, written when the
	# certificate came from a public CA whose chain ends at a cross-signed root. Against a
	# private CA that would have thrown away the only certificate that matters and trusted the
	# public roots instead: the cluster would accept anything a public CA had ever issued for
	# the pinned name, and reject the certificate it was actually given.
	#
	# A private root needs none of it. It is self-signed, so it is already an anchor -- which
	# is the property Let's Encrypt's cross-signed chain could not provide and the reason
