// A SQLite VFS whose files live in FoundationDB.
//
// This is the store described in README.md, beside this file. There is no
// local file, so an actor's database moves between machines with no copy and no restore
// step.
//
// Why a VFS and not a key and value table. A VFS gives SQLite its pages one page at a
// time, so SQLite reads the pages a query touches and no others. Three things follow, and
// none of them is true of the Elixir prototype this replaces:
//
//   - An actor is not limited by memory. The working set is in memory and the rest is in
//     FoundationDB, which is what makes the 10 GiB limit in `Weft.Limits` possible.
//   - A handoff copies nothing. A different machine opens the same database and reads
//     pages. There is no restore step and no transfer, so a large actor moves as fast as
//     a small one. `prove_handoff.c` is that property on its own.
//   - Compaction is not weft's to get wrong. The prototype's replicator folds a log by
//     hand and has a race. The layout below moves that work into one place with one
//     owner, and `Store.lean` proves the rule the fold must obey.
//
// Layout. rivet's Depot layout, modelled in docs/spec/Store.lean:
//
//   weft/db/<name>/HEAD                 the txid of the newest commit
//   weft/db/<name>/SIZE                 the file size, 8 bytes big endian
//   weft/db/<name>/FENCE                the ownership fence
//   weft/db/<name>/PIDX/<pgno>          the txid that owns a page
//   weft/db/<name>/DELTA/<txid>/<pgno>  the pages of one commit
//   weft/db/<name>/SHARD/<as_of>/<pgno> a compacted base, versioned by as_of
//   weft/db/<name>/SHARDN/<as_of>       the page count of a shard version
//   weft/db/<name>/LOGN                 the page count of the log since compaction
//
// A read finds the owner in PIDX and then reads one of DELTA or SHARD. So a read touches
// two rows whatever the log holds, which `Store.lean` proves as `read_touches_two_rows`.
//
// A commit is one FoundationDB transaction. The VFS holds the pages SQLite writes in
// memory, and it sends them when SQLite syncs the file. The pages of a commit go under
// one txid first, where no read can see them. One transaction then points PIDX at that
// txid and advances the head. A process that dies part way through leaves either the
// whole commit or none of it.
//
// Losing the commit that was in flight is correct. `Weft.Actor.Store` accepts that a
// crash loses the last few commits. Leaving pages from two commits is a different
// failure, because a reader cannot see it and it loses the whole actor.
//
// What a caller must set. Two pragmas, and neither is a tuning knob.
//
// `PRAGMA journal_mode=MEMORY`. The commit above is atomic, so a rollback journal on disk
// adds cost and protects nothing.
//
// `PRAGMA locking_mode=EXCLUSIVE`. Without it SQLite reads page 1 to check the change
// counter at the start of every read transaction, and over a database on the network that
// check is a round trip for every query. The pragma tells SQLite that nothing else can
// change the file, so it trusts its page cache and stops the re-read. An actor is the
// single writer of its own store, so the statement is true. It was worth more than the
// layout of the pages; weft's `docs/logbook/store.md` holds the number.
//
// Every transaction runs in the retry loop that FoundationDB documents.
// `fdb_transaction_on_error` decides if an error may be retried, and waits before the
// next attempt. A fence mismatch is not retried, because refusing the write is the
// correct answer.
//
// Locking is a no-op. An actor is the single writer of its own store. The fence, not a
// lock, is what stops a second writer. See the Weft moduledoc.
//
// How to read this file. It has four layers, and each one uses only the layer above it:
//
//   1. Keys.        `key_pidx` and the rest build one key each. A number goes into a key
//                   big endian, so the order of the keys is the order of the numbers.
//   2. Transactions. `run_txn` runs a body and retries it the way FoundationDB asks. Each
//                   body is a small function named `*_body`, and it reads and writes
//                   through the helpers above it. A body can run more than once, so it
//                   must build its own state every time.
//   3. Pages.       `page_from_store` reads one page, and the dirty buffer holds the
//                   pages SQLite wrote but has not committed.
//   4. SQLite.      `fdb_read`, `fdb_write`, `fdb_sync` and the rest are what SQLite
//                   calls. `flush` is where a commit happens.

// It used to be `FDB_TXN_LIMIT / PIDX_ROW`, charging KEYMAX for every row. KEYMAX is the
// size of the *buffer* a key is built in, not the size of a key: `key_pidx` writes
// "weft/db/<name>/PIDX/" and four big-endian bytes, so a row is 18 + strlen(name) + 8. For
// a name of ten characters that is 36 bytes against the 648 that were charged, and the
// ceiling on an atomic commit was 18 times lower than the format requires — 63 MB where
// 1.1 GB fits. TPC-C found it: a warehouse is about 60 MB of rows and the load failed with
// SQLITE_IOERR_WRITE, which SQLite reports as "disk I/O error" while naming no limit.
//
// The budget is now the real one, computed once per file because the name does not change

// `flush` commits one file, because that is what SQLite gives it: one `xSync` for one
// database. So two databases cannot be committed together by anything above, and a grant
// that takes an item from one and gives it to another is two transactions with a gap.
//
// This is the parallel commit protocol, modelled in ParallelCommits.tla. The names below
// are that spec's, because a protocol implemented under different words is a protocol
// nobody can check against its model:
//
//   intent write          the pages of one participant, staged under a txid whose head has
//                         not moved. `flush` already writes exactly this shape for a
//                         commit too large for one transaction.
//   transaction record    `weft/txn/<txnid>`, holding the status and the participants.
//   implicitly committed  the record is staging, and every participant's intent is there.
//                         This is the commit point, and it costs one round.
//   explicitly committed  the record says committed, which recovery or the committer
//                         writes afterwards. It changes no read.
//   resolve intent        move that participant's head, which is what makes its staged
//                         pages reachable.
//   prevent               raise that database's fence, so the staging writer can never
//                         land. The fence is this layout's timestamp cache: it is the one
//                         thing that stops a write that has not happened yet.
//
// The order is what makes it safe. Every participant stages first, and no head has moved,
// so nothing is visible. One transaction then writes the record. That single write is the
// commit: after it lands the group is implicitly committed whether or not this process
// survives, because every intent is already durable and any other process can see both
// facts. Moving the heads afterwards changes nothing about whether it committed.
//
// A crash before the record leaves intents nobody can reach, and recovery aborts them. A
// crash after the record leaves a group that is committed but not resolved, and recovery
// finishes it. There is no third case, which is the property `prove_parallel_commit`
// looks for.
//
// One limit, and it is enforced rather than assumed: a participant must stage in one
// FoundationDB transaction. That makes an intent all or nothing, so recovery can decide a
// participant by reading one key instead of counting pages. A participant with more pages
// than one transaction carries is refused at stage time.
